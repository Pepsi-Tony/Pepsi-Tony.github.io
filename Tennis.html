		<p class="t1">The predecessor of tennis was a game called "handball" that was popular in the French court in the 14th century. The rule is that two players, separated by a rope, use their palms to hit each other with a ball made of cloth wrapped in hair. Afterwards, the game was developed and improved, and the rope was replaced by a net, and the hand hitting was changed to a wooden racket, and then the wooden racket was pulled on the string. Beginning in the 18th century, this game also began to appear among European folks, and it became popular in Europe in the 19th century.

        Modern tennis was invented in England by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield in December 1873 as a game for entertaining guests at backyard parties. He created the game based on the old game of indoor tennis or proto-tennis. According to most tennis historians, most of the rules of modern tennis were borrowed by Winfield from handball, indoor tennis, and French royal tennis.</p><br><br><hr><br><br>
